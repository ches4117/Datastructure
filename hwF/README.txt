This program use three sorting algorithm, bubble sort, selection sort, quick sort.
Bubble sort is the slowest, it should run the whole array two times.
Selection sort is faster than Bubble sort. In every loop, we will find the smallest
one and set it at the sorted partion. Quick sort is the fatest, we will set a pivot,
smaller than pivot set at left, and bigger set at right. In every loop ,pivot will 
cut the array into two partions. 

Bubble sort and selection sort will quicker if the array is short.
Quick sort will slower if the array is sorted.
