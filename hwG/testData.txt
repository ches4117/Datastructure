Assignment 3 Hashing TA: Pierre (PPLindenberg@gmail.com) Deadline: TBA Implement a hash function This homework s objective is to use an array to implement hash tables and design hash functions. As a first step, you need to design your own hash function. Hash function A hash function is any function that can be used to map digital data of arbitrary size to digital data of fixed size  Your hash function will be used later for a hash table. The hash table will have ten (10) buckets with one (1) slot each. It will be good to think of a hash function that has as few collisions as possible for 10 buckets. The data will be given in strings with variable length. Hash table The next task is to use your hash function to store data into a hash table. Please read data from a file into your program and store the data into your hash table. After all data has been added to the hash table, print the whole hash table on the console. The challenge in this part is the collision handling, because the hash table s buckets can only store one (1) data at a time. It is up to you how your program handles collisions. The only requirement is that data must not be lost. All data that has been input into your program needs to be somewhere. Please print a small statistic of your table afterwards. Please consider at least the following points in your statistic: Number of the data How big is your hash table? (buckets) How many buckets are filled after you added all data? How many collisions happened? Here is an example output of the program:
