This program uses the basic hash function. I find the number one of every block of string, and divide this character, saving the remainder.
I find the bucket use thie remainder, if the bucket has thing, because I use linked list to solve the problem of collision. I will find
this bucket of the next node, and store the string. And in the next hash funciton, I can freedomly input a number to divide every block of the string.

Ths quesiont if use linear probing, then it should have 200~300 big to save the data.
If I use chaining ,then it will use smaller than using linked probing.
